One of the main issues in developing a license plate detection and recognition system is the lack of good quality data. In this project, we fine-tuned a pix2pix GAN model to generate plates that are very similar to real plates with a huge variety of noises, rotations, brightness, etc. In order to generate more than 500 types of plate noise patterns, we saved the model after each batch of training. Then, more than 5000 models were evaluated by our data cleaning members and finally more than 500 models were selected.

If you need to develop a similar model, please contact me.
